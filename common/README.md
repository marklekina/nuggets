# Nuggets

This directory contains the common code for the CS50 "Nuggets" game; including the game data structure, player data structure, grid data structure and XYZ message handling module.

Together, these programs enable the functionality of game play.

## Materials provided

See the [support library](support/README.md) for some useful modules. Examples include, message.h, mem.h, file.h

See the [maps](maps/README.md) for some draft maps.

## Assumptions

We also were provided with a client since we were a group of three. 
We  have code for the visiblity and gold distribution, but haven't had time to implement it perfectly.

On a smaller level, we assumed for a few of our getters and setters that the given parameters were not NULL. The greatly reduced pointer errors/warnings.

## Issues
See implementation spec for the issues we ran into during this lab
