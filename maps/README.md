# Maps

This directory contains maps on which the game is played:

* `big.txt`: a very large map
* `challenge.txt`: a very tricky map
* `edges.txt`: a small map that bumps into the edges of the grid
* `fewspots.txt`: a map with too-few empty spots to support a game with 26 players and many gold piles.
* `hole.txt`: a map in which one room has a hole in it.
* `main.txt`: an interesting map for playing and testing.
* `narrow.txt`: a very narrow map that will fit in a very narrow window.
* `small.txt`: a simple, small map; also too-few empty spots.

Several maps were contributed by Dartmouth CS50 student teams. Note that some of the contributed maps are not entirely valid.

* `contrib19s`: maps contributed by student teams in 19S.
* `contrib21s`: maps contributed by student teams in 21S.
